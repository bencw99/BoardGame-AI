BoardGame-AI
============
This project involves the creation of a board game framework development of an artificially intelligent player applicable to a general deterministic turn-based board game.
An AI Player for checkers has been developed using the minimax algoithm and alpha-beta pruning. 
This player is being improved, and will be generalized to all board games made with the given board game classes.
For a demonstration of the checkers player, download the jar file from my website, bencw99.github.io/CheckersGame.zip
